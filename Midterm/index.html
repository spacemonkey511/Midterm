                    <p>Diablo IV is a 2023 mulitplayer-only action role-playing game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. 
                        It is the fourth main installment in the Diablo series. Announced at BlizzCon 2019, the game was released on June 5, 
                        2023 for the Playstation and XBOX consoles, and Microsoft Windows. Players create from one of five playable classes --
                        Barbarian, Druid, Necromancer, Rogue, or Sorcerer -- and use their skills to complete quests through combat. The game had 
                        a lengthy early access period, with public betas available from March 2023 and official early access beginning on June 1.
                        Staple features returned from previous installments in the franchise, such as a focus on replayable, procedurally generated
                        dungeons and loot-focused character-building, while also featuring mechanics new to the series, including an open world 
                        and player versus player combat. Diablo IV received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the game's 
                        narrative, atmosphere, and replay value.
