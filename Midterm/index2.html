                    <p>Final Fantasy XVI is a 2023 action role-playing game developed and published by Square Enix. The sixteenth main 
                        installment in the Final Fantasy series, it was released for the Playstion 5 as a timed exclusive.<br> The game 
                        features segmented open environments and an action-based combat system involving melee and magic-based attacks.
                        There are recurring series features including Chocobos, and summoned monsters called Eikons,<br> which are both fought
                        as bosses and used through channelling their power in combat. <br><br>
                        Final Fantasy XVI is set in the fictional world of Valisthea, a world divided between six nations who hold power
                        through access to magical Crystals and Dominants, humans who act as hosts for each nation's Eikon. Tensions <br>between
                        the nations escalate as a magical drought dubbed the Blight begins consuming the land. Clive Rosfield, guardian to his
                        younger brother Joshua, witnesses his kingdom destroyed and becomes involved in the growing <br>conflict between Valisthea's
                        nations and the secret power behind the war tied to the dark Eikon Ifrit.
                        Upon release, the game was well-received by critics. Praise was given to its story, characters, music, and combat system.<br><br>
                        Criticism focused on its lack of deeper role-playing elements, framerate issues for its performance mode, and side quest
                        design. It sold over 3 million copies worldwide on its first week of release.
